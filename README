This is a Menu Bar wrapper for hostfiles (the cli Perl script for managing multiple hostfile configurations on *NIX systems).

To get started you need to install hostfiles and get it up and running.  You can find more information at https://github.com/Aneurysm9/hostfile_manager.  After this drag the application to your Applications folder and then double-click it ifrom there to run it.

Using the hostfile manager is simple.  Click on the grasshopper icon in the Menu Bar, then click on a named hostfile to enable/disable it.  A checkmark indicates that the hostfile fragment is enabled and unmodified.  A minus sign indicates that the hostfile fragment is enabled, but has been modified.
